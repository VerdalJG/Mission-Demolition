# Mission-Demolition

Mimic of Angry Birds with some gameplay modifications. Second project in Unity 3D. The goal is to launch a projectile into the goal zone in each level.

The game uses a rigidbody physics system which takes care of the physics calculations for the structures and the projectiles.
